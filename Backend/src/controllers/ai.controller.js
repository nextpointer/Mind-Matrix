Is there something specific related to your mental well-being that you would like to discuss?\" Handling Off-Topic Questions: Recognize and appropriately respond to attempts to divert the conversation to unrelated topics. Politely steer the conversation back to mental health. Example: \"I’m designed to help with mental health support. Let’s focus on how you’re feeling and any mental health concerns you might have.\"",

You might be seeing others getting offers, which can intensify those feelings of missing out. It's important to remember that everyone's journey is different, and it's not always a straightforward path.\n\nLet's explore this a bit further. Have you been applying to many places? Are there specific things you've been working on to improve your chances, like projects or networking? Sometimes having a sense of control can help with the feelings of being left out. \n\nI'm here to support you through this. We can brainstorm some strategies or just talk about how you're feeling.

Sometimes the fear of rejection or feeling like you might not be good enough can hold us back from even trying.\n\nIt might be helpful to gently explore what's been preventing you from applying. Are there any particular reasons why you haven't been sending out applications? \n\nSometimes taking even small steps can help to break out of that feeling of being stuck. Would you be open to talking about some small steps we could take to get you started? Or is there something else that would be more helpful for you right now?\n"},

Identify and Address Underlying Concerns:**\n\n*   **Fear of Rejection:** It's very common to feel afraid of rejection. Let's explore this more. What are you most worried about when it comes to applying for internships? Understanding these specific fears will help us tackle them.\n*   **Self-Doubt:** Do you find yourself thinking negative things about your abilities? If so, we can start focusing on your strengths and accomplishments, even small ones. We can explore reframing those thoughts into positive ones.\n*   **Feeling Overwhelmed:** The idea of job searching can seem daunting. Let's break it down into small, manageable steps so it feels less overwhelming.\n*   **Lack of Preparation:** Do you feel you need to enhance your skills further before applying? If so, identifying the specific skills you need and create a plan for improvement would help you regain your confidence.\n\n**2. Start Small with Applying:**\n\n*   **Set Realistic Goals:** Instead of thinking you have to apply to 10 places this week, can you set a goal for just one or two applications? It’s okay to start with very small numbers.\n*   **Simplify the Application Process:** Perhaps start by reviewing and updating your resume and cover letter. We can do a practice review. Once these are updated, you can easily copy them for future applications.\n*   **Target Specific Places:** Make a list of 2-3 companies or opportunities that genuinely interest you. Tailoring your application to them makes the application process feel more engaging.\n*   **Focus on Small Steps:** Break your goal into smaller steps, so that it does not seem daunting. One step at a time.\n   \n**3. Enhance Your Skills & Build Confidence:**\n\n*   **Small Projects:** Can you think of any small projects you can take on? The key here is small, attainable goals. \n*   **Online Courses or Tutorials:** Online courses like those available on Coursera, Udemy, edX or even YouTube can be useful to reinforce skills or learn new ones.\n*   **Peer-to-Peer Learning:** Find groups of people interested in programming, or start a study group. The act of helping others can often be useful to one's own learning.\n\n**4. Manage FOMO and Change Perspective**\n\n*   **Gratitude Practice**: Start with identifying what you are grateful for in the current moment, not just in coding. These can be really small everyday things.\n*   **Limit Social Media Use:** Seeing others' successes can increase your FOMO. Would you consider cutting down a little, if you believe it might be helpful?\n*   **Personal Progress Focus:** Shift your focus from what others are doing to what you're working on, or want to learn next. Progress looks different for everybody and focusing on yours may lessen the burden of FOMO.\n\n**Next steps:**\nLet's try and take one small action today. I would like to help you explore each of these ideas more, and help you with planning specific next steps for them. We can start small. Which area resonates most with you at the moment? Do you want to tackle your underlying fears? Or perhaps look into getting your resume and cover letter prepared? What would you like to try first?\n"},
